# unc-3 points is expressed DA and DB in L1s (Prasad et al., 2008)
# We confirmed that L1 animals shortly after hatching
# showed expression of unc-3 in the embryonic DA and DB 
# motor neurons; no staining of the DD neurons was detected

# But annotated DA_DB part of cluster 3

# has to be motor neurons b/c of unc-3
# in close proximity of P lineage cells
# so may be AB.p lineage descendant motor neurons

# AS1-11 shouldn't have been born yet -- descendants of P1-11
# DA1-9 are there
# DB1-7 are there
# VA1 and VB2 not there, descendants of W
# VA2-12 not there, descendant of P2-12
# VB1,3-11 not there, descendants of P1-10
# VC1-6 not there, descendants of P3-8
# VD1 not there, descendant of W
# VD2-13 not there, descendants of P1-12
