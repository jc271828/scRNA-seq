According to Wormbook (http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_mechanosensation/mechanosensation.html), there are 6 touch receptor neurons in worms: 2 ALM, 2 PLM, AVM, PVM

All of them express mec-3/7/17. They also express unc-86 (see Lineage-Specific regulators couple cell lineage asymmetry to the transcription of the Caenorhabditis elegans POU gene unc-86 during neurogenesis Fig 1)
